# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview

This project predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using **Machine Learning**.
It is a beginner-friendly **classification project** that demonstrates the complete **data science workflow** from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Given passenger details such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, and family information, the goal is to predict:

* **Survived = 1** → Passenger survived
* **Survived = 0** → Passenger did not survive

This is a **binary classification problem**.

## 📂 Dataset

* Dataset used: **Titanic Dataset**
* Source: Publicly available Kaggle Titanic dataset
* Format: CSV file

### Key Features:

* `Pclass` – Ticket class
* `Sex` – Gender
* `Age` – Passenger age
* `Fare` – Ticket fare
* `Embarked` – Port of embarkation
* `FamilySize` – Derived feature

Target Variable:

* `Survived`
* 
## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **Pandas & NumPy** – Data handling
* **Scikit-learn** – Machine Learning
* **Google Colab** – Development environment

## 🔍 Project Workflow

1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Data cleaning and handling missing values
3. Feature engineering (FamilySize)
4. Encoding categorical variables
5. Splitting data into training and testing sets
6. Training model using **Logistic Regression**
7. Evaluating model performance using accuracy

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model

* **Algorithm Used:** Logistic Regression
* **Reason:**

  * Best suited for binary classification
  * Easy to understand and interpret
  * Good baseline model for beginners

## 📊 Model Evaluation

* Metric Used: **Accuracy Score**
* The model predicts survival with reasonable accuracy using key features like:

  * Gender
  * Passenger class
  * Fare
  * Family size

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Try Decision Tree or Random Forest models
* Perform feature scaling
* Add more visualizations
* Improve accuracy with hyperparameter tuning
